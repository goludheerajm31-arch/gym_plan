This project is a simple and intuitive web-based Fitness Tracker built using Python (Flask) ,  HTML  , and CSS It allows users to plan and track their daily workouts, create custom exercises, and monitor water intake in a clean and minimal interface. The application does not require any database setup; all data is stored locally in a JSON file, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

The main features of this application include a **dashboard** that summarizes the total sets, reps, and water consumed for the day. Users can view their planned workouts, log new exercises, and remove exercises from their daily plan. The water intake tracker allows users to record drinks of different volumes and keep track of their hydration goals throughout the day.

Users can also add **custom workouts** by specifying the exercise name, muscle group, sets, reps, and optional notes. The app includes a collection of common exercises categorized by muscle groups for quick addition to the daily plan. The interface is designed to be simple, responsive, and aesthetically clean, focusing on usability without unnecessary distractions.

This project demonstrates the use of Flask routing, template rendering, and **local JSON data storage, combined with modern CSS for a polished look. Since the data is stored locally, the app can be run and tested easily without any external dependencies or databases.

To run the project, simply install Flask, run the main Python file, and open the web application in a browser. The app is responsive and lightweight, providing a smooth and simple experience for tracking workouts and hydration.

This project serves as a foundation that can be extended with additional features, such as user authentication or cloud storage integration for persistent data across devices.
